# Comparision

### I will create an actual Native iOS application (in xcode), and then recreate it using this library.

### Then I will see if I can tell the difference

## Contents
Each app will have a Navigation Bar, and 2 items in the Tab bar.
Tab Bar items:
- Trash Can
- Folder

The main content will just be a large image of the Tab Bar's icon.

*This is very simple, mainly due to a lack of elements in the Native Framework as of this moment*
I believe the biggest challenge will be to get the items positioned differently, because the 2 platforms have fundamentally different layout systems. iOS uses a constraint system, whereas HTML uses the box model system.

## Result

Here is an image of the result:

**The left is the website, and right is native app**. I would say that the results are quite good, there are some very subtle differences, but overall it does look like a native app.
